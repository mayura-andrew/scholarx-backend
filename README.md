## Prerequisites

Before you can start using this project, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (version 14 or later)
- npm (version 6 or later)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the ScholarX backend:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/scholarx-backend.git
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Copy the `.env` file:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. Replace the environment variables in the newly created `.env` file with your configuration.

5. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

6. Run Tests:

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

7. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:${server_port}` to access the running server.

## Docker Setup

If you prefer to use Docker for development, follow these steps:

1. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your machine. You can download them from here https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/.

2. Build the Docker images:

```docker-compose build```

3. Start the Docker containers:

```docker-compose up```

4. The application and its services are now running in Docker containers. You can access the application at ```http://localhost:${SERVER_PORT}```, where ```SERVER_PORT``` is the port number specified in your ```.env``` file.

5. To stop the Docker containers, use the following commnd:

```docker-compose down```

Please note that the Docker Compose setup assumes that you have a ```.env``` file in your project root. You can create one by copying the ```.env.example``` file:

```cp .env.example .env```

Then, replace the environment variables in the newly created ```.env``` file with your configuration.


Remember to replace ```${SERVER_PORT}``` with the actual port number if it's a fixed value. If it's specified in the ```.env``` file, you can leave it as is.
